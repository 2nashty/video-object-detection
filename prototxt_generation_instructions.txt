Use absolute paths for simplicity.

First, copy the model's train_val.prototxt to data/imagenet/<wnid_dir>/aux
Then change the files for each "source:" and "mean_file:" line to the lmbd
files and image mean created by prepare_data.py.

Copy the model's solver.prototxt to data/imagenet/<wnid_dir>/aux
Change the "net:" path to the path to the train_val.prototxt you just created.
Change the "snapshot_prefix:" to data/imagenet/<wnid_dir>/snapshots
Change the "sorver_mode:" to CPU

The deploy.prototxt appears to be difficult to generate. NIN unfortunately
doesn't provide one. See https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/1245
and https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/261


## Some reference documentation
  This github issue is wildly helpful:
