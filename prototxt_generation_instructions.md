  The deploy.prototxt appears to be difficult to generate. NIN unfortunately
  doesn't provide one. See https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/1245
  and https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/261

This github issue is wildly helpful:
  https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/550
This documentation is good too:
